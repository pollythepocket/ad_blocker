#Makeshift Ad Blocker

Makeshift Ad Blocker was in response to a lot of my favorite ad blockers no longer supported by Chrome, so I thought might as well make my own.

I am quite new to this type of programming, so I apologize is someone feels this is not optimal. Feel feel to DM [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polly-ruhnke-573440224/) or submit an error here.

Version one is still being programed

This terrible icon was designed in canvas by me, Polly Ruhnke, so all credits to the Canvas webiste and five minutes of my time
