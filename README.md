# Makeshift Ad Blocker

Makeshift Ad Blocker was created in response to many of my favorite ad blockers no longer being supported by Chrome. I thought, why not create my own?

I am quite new to this type of programming, so I apologize if someone feels this is not optimal. Feel free to DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polly-ruhnke-573440224/) or submit an error here.

### Disclaimer

Version one is still being programmed.

### Icon Design Disclaimer

This simple icon was designed in Canvas by me, Polly Ruhnke, so all credits go to the Canvas website and five minutes of my time.
